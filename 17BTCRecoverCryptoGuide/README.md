*BTCRecover* is an open source wallet password and seed recovery tool.

For seed based recovery, this is primarily useful in situations where you have lost/forgotten parts of your mnemonic, or have made an error transcribing it. (So you are either seeing an empty wallet or getting an error that your seed is invalid)

For wallet password or passphrase recovery, it is primarily useful if you have a reasonable idea about what your password might be.

## Setup and Usage Tutorials ##
BTCRecover is a Python (3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10) script so will run on Windows, Linux and Mac environments. [See the installation guide for more info](docs/INSTALL.md)

[I have created a growing playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7rfJxwogDzmd1IanPrmlTg3ewAIq-BZJ) that covers a number of usage examples for using this tool to recover seed phrases, BIP39 passphrases, etc.

This repository also included some example commands and file templates in the ./docs/ folder of the repository.

My suggestion is that you find a scenario that is most-like your situation and try to replicate my examples to ensure that you have the tool set up and running correctly. If you have a specific situation that isn't covered in these tutorials, let me know and I can look into creating a video for that.

If you don't know an address in the wallet that you are searching for, you can create and use an [Address Database (click here for guide)](docs/Creating_and_Using_AddressDB.md) _There is no real performance penalty for doing this, it just takes a bit more work to set up_.

## Quick Start ##

To try recovering your password or a BIP39 passphrase, please start with the **[Password Recovery Quick Start](docs/TUTORIAL.md#btcrecover-tutorial)**.

If you mostly know your recovery seed/mnemonic (12-24 recovery words), but think there may be a mistake in it, please see the **[Seed Recovery Quick Start](docs/Seedrecover_Quick_Start_Guide.md)**.
