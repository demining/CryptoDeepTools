* We will again touch on the topic of a signature failure in a blockchain transaction and apply a completely new attack: “WhiteBox Attack on Bitcoin” .
Differential fault analysis (DFA)was briefly described in the literature in 1996 when an Israeli cryptographer and cryptanalyst Eli Biham and an Israeli scientist Adi Shamir showed that they could use error injection to extract the secret key and recover the private key using various signature and verification algorithms.
