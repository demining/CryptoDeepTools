## [13TeslaBrainWallet](https://github.com/demining/CryptoDeepTools/tree/main/13TeslaBrainWallet)


* There are many forms to create a Bitcoin wallet. One of the first methods to create a Bitcoin wallet was known as BrainWallet. BrainWallet is convenient in the sense that it allows you to store a "passphrase" in memory or in a notebook. The passphrase is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm, and is used as the seed to generate the private key. Due to its popularity and ease of use, many BrainWallets over the past few years have been used with weak passphrases. This weak private key generation method allowed attackers to steal quite a lot of BTC coins by simply cracking the password against the hashes stored on the blockchain. Let's move on to the experimental part:

## [28DustAttack](https://github.com/demining/CryptoDeepTools/tree/main/28DustAttack)


* "Dust Attack" known as: "Dusting Attack" or "Crypto Dust". Perhaps every cryptocurrency user or holder of a large amount of BTC, ETH coins replaced the receipt of an insignificantly small amount of coins in satoshi on their cryptocurrency wallet, this receipt is disguised as “Donate”, but in fact it is a whole mathematically refined system for taking away all the accumulated coins of the wallet for balance. Let's look at two different examples of dust attacks to shed light on all the intricacies of this manipulation and what risks can await users and holders of the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin. To carry out a dust attack, confirmation of isomorphism by miners plays an important role, because From 2022 to 2024, many cryptocurrency services and hardware wallets are actively fighting the dust attack. At the moment, the method of independently creating dust transactions on your own cold wallet has become widely popular. Let's transform the dust transaction into isomorphism, according to the theory, two transactions must be confirmed by miners. Having created the RawTX of the dust attack, we send a small amount of 555 satoshi, then we receive an isomorphism of the first transaction, where a reverse transfer of funds occurs from the balance of the victim of the dust attack.

## [33FuzzingBitcoin](https://github.com/demining/CryptoDeepTools/tree/main/33FuzzingBitcoin)


* Fuzzing is a software testing method used to identify vulnerabilities and errors by introducing random or specially generated data into a program's input. In the context of cryptanalysis, Fuzzing testing is used to test cryptographic algorithms and systems for weaknesses that can be exploited by attackers. Applying Fuzzing testing to cryptocurrency wallets has several benefits: Detecting vulnerabilities and Improving reliability. Incorrect data processing in cryptographic operations can lead to private key leaks or other critical vulnerabilities, as well as errors in transaction processing: Fuzzing can reveal errors in transaction processing logic that can lead to incorrect transactions or even loss of funds. At the beginning of 2024, modern technologies that develop the pre-trained Bitcoin ChatGPT model and find effective ways to solve complex cryptographic problems that underlie the fuzzing testing method gained widespread popularity. Let's consider an example of building the structure of a vulnerable Raw transaction that uses the BitcoinChatGPT module.

Let’s move on to the practical part of the article and consider an example using a Bitcoin wallet:  1DMX2ByJZVkWeKG1mhjpwcMvDmGSUAmi5P The main issue: Errors in calculating the order of the secp256k1 group lead to private keys being created outside the valid range [1, N). This causes: Generation of 50% invalid keys in Bitcoin wallets Irrecoverable loss of funds (keys fail ECDSA validation) Risk of compromising HD wallets and smart contracts Historical parallels: Randstorm vulnerability (2011-2016): mass generation of weak keys Failures in HSM modules (2015): compromise of corporate wallets Why it matters: The is_private_key_valid function legitimizes mathematically incorrect keys, creating a false sense of security. This video provides a technical analysis of elliptic curve errors and tools to verify your wallets. Who should watch: Crypto investors, blockchain developers, cybersecurity specialists.
