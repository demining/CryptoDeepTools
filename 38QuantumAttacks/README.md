<p>Many crypto experts are asking: Will the cryptocurrency industry be able to withstand the new technological revolution? This article will discuss modern methods of protecting financial transactions and the Internet based on cryptography, which may be powerless against a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, and whether cryptocurrencies, whose market is estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars, are vulnerable. The study shows that the proof-of-work algorithm used in Bitcoin is relatively resistant to quantum attacks in the next decade, due to the high speed of specialized mining equipment. However, the elliptic curve digital signature system used by Bitcoin may be hacked by 2027. As an alternative,&nbsp;<a href="https://keyhunters.ru/quantum-resistance-and-momentum-algorithm">the Momentum algorithm</a>&nbsp;is considered , which is more resistant to quantum computing. Other protection methods that can ensure the security and efficiency of blockchain applications in the future are also analyzed.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, as a decentralized and cryptographically protected digital currency, has been successfully in existence since 2008, inspiring the creation of many other cryptocurrencies. Its security is ensured by the proof-of-work mechanism and elliptic curve cryptographic signatures. However, the development of quantum computers poses a serious threat to Bitcoin and all modern cryptography used on the Internet and financial transactions. Research shows that the proof-of-work algorithm used in Bitcoin is relatively resistant to quantum attacks in the next 10 years due to the high speed of specialized mining equipment. But the elliptic curve digital signature system is vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm and could be hacked as early as 2027, allowing attackers to obtain secret keys from Bitcoin transactions and private keys from public ones. Alternative algorithms such as Momentum for proof-of-work and quantum-resistant signature schemes are proposed as a solution. Overall, the findings suggest that quantum computers pose a serious threat to Bitcoin, and new security methods need to be developed to ensure its future security. Quantum computers could&nbsp;<a href="https://keyhunters.ru/quantum-computers-will-hack-bitcoin-in-five-years-opinion/"><em>hack Bitcoin within five years</em></a>&nbsp;.

<p>In this part of the article, we will try to explain how Bitcoin works to make it easier to understand possible attacks using quantum computers. The description is given in general terms, since the basic principles of operation are similar to other cryptocurrencies. All transactions are recorded in a public registry – blockchain. Transactions are combined into blocks, which are considered to have occurred simultaneously and are built into a chain. Each block contains a link to the previous one in the form of its hash. New blocks are added by miners using the “proof-of-work” mechanism (Proof-of-Work, PoW). Bitcoin uses the Hashcash algorithm. Miners look for a suitable block header so that its hash is less than a certain value. The header contains information about transactions, the hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and a random number (nonce). The difficulty of the task is selected automatically so that the block is found in about 10 minutes. Bitcoin uses double hashing SHA256.</p>

<p>Miners add the transactions they choose to a block and are rewarded in bitcoins for doing so. When a miner finds a suitable header, they notify the network and the block is added to the blockchain. It is easy to verify the correctness of a PoW solution – you only need to calculate the hash once. PoW is needed to prevent one participant from faking the blockchain, for example, to spend the same money twice. The blockchain can branch, but miners must work on the longest chain. A transaction in Bitcoin is considered confirmed when 6 more blocks are added after it. The article discusses what&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/quantum-attacks-on-bitcoin">advantage a quantum computer</a>&nbsp;can give when solving PoW and whether it can faking the blockchain. The structure of transactions is also analyzed. When Bob wants to send bitcoins to Alice, Alice creates a pair of keys – private and public. The public key is hashed and the result is an address, which Alice tells Bob. Bitcoin uses the hash of the public key to save space. To send bitcoins, Bob specifies the transactions where he received bitcoins to his addresses. The amount of bitcoins received must be at least as much as the amount Bob wants to send to Alice. Bob proves ownership of the addresses by providing public keys and signing the message with his private key. The choice to use a hash of the public key instead of the key itself affects Bitcoin’s security against quantum attacks.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the most part, a quantum computer can be more efficient than a conventional computer at mining Bitcoin, that is, at performing Proof-of-Work (PoW) based on the hashcash algorithm. A quantum computer using the Grover search algorithm can perform PoW by trying significantly fewer hash options than a classical computer. However, modern ASIC miners, which specialize in calculating hashes, work so fast that this advantage of quantum computers is leveled out, given that the speed of quantum computers is still relatively low. In the future, if the speed of quantum computers can be increased to 100 GHz, they will be able to solve the PoW problem about 100 times faster than now. But this is unlikely to happen in the next 10 years. By that time, both conventional computers will have become faster and quantum technologies will have become more widespread, so no one will be able to single-handedly dominate mining. To assess the security of a blockchain, it is important to understand how much computing power&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/quantum-attacks-on-bitcoin">a quantum computer would need to successfully solve a PoW problem</a>&nbsp;with a probability greater than 50%. As a result, although quantum computers can theoretically speed up the mining process, in practice, due to the limitations of current technologies, they do not yet pose a serious threat to Bitcoin security. However, in the future, with the development of quantum technologies, this threat may become more real, and it is necessary to develop appropriate security measures to determine how effective a quantum computer can be in mining Bitcoin, taking into account all the technical difficulties and limitations. Grover’s algorithm allows a quantum computer to search for a solution (a suitable block header) much faster than a classical one, but in practice this advantage is greatly reduced.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calculating the SHA256 hash on a quantum computer requires converting logical operations into reversible quantum operations, which increases the complexity. In addition, quantum computers need to correct errors, which also requires additional resources and time. As a result, the mining speed of a quantum computer depends not only on Grover’s algorithm, but also on many other factors, such as the clock frequency, error rate, complexity of error correction algorithms, and the number of qubits used. The article introduces the concept of “effective hash rate” for a quantum computer (hQC), which takes all these factors into account. The analysis shows that at the current level of technology development, quantum computers are significantly inferior to specialized ASIC miners in hash rate. However, it is expected that in the future, quantum technologies will develop and their performance will increase. The article provides forecasts for the next 25 years and estimates when quantum computers will be able to surpass classical ones in Bitcoin mining. Even if a quantum computer cannot control mining on its own, it could be used to attack mining pools using smart contracts. A small advantage in hashing speed would allow attackers to profit from block manipulation and hold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the time constraints, the effective hash rate improves asymptotically with the square root of the problem complexity, reflecting the advantage of quantum processors. Grover’s algorithm can be run in parallel on multiple quantum processors. Ideally, each processor searches the entire possible solution space. This reduces the number of oracle queries required to find a solution. As a result, the time to find a solution is reduced and the overall hash rate increases. Grover’s algorithm requires a fixed number of logical qubits (2402), regardless of the complexity of the problem. However, the number of physical qubits required depends on the error correction methods used and is related to the complexity of the problem and the probability of errors.</p>

<p>To estimate the achievable performance, superconducting circuits are considered, which are currently the fastest quantum technologies and have good scaling prospects. At the maximum operating speed of elements and certain assumptions about the error rate and the complexity of the problem,&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/quantum-attacks-on-bitcoin">the effective hash rate of a quantum computer</a>&nbsp;is 13.8 GH/s, which requires the use of 4.4 million physical qubits. This is thousands of times slower than modern ASIC devices, which achieve a speed of 14 TH/s. The reason lies in the low operating speed of quantum elements and the delays associated with the creation of fault-tolerant T-elements. It is expected that quantum technologies will develop rapidly in the future, and a “quantum version of Moore’s Law” will occur, which will affect the clock rate, element accuracy and the number of qubits.

<p>It will obviously take time for quantum computers to outperform classical machines at the mining task. Even when they do, no single quantum computer will have overwhelming power. However, even a small advantage in power over other miners could make certain types of attacks profitable, such as those on mining pools that use smart contracts. For example, under certain optimistic assumptions, a group of 20 quantum machines working in parallel could have 0.1% of the total hashing power. This is enough to attack mining pools and reduce their profits by 10% with minimal bribery costs.</p>

<p>Bitcoin uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), based on the secp256k1 curve, to create signatures. The security of this system relies on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/discrete-logarithm/">(ECDLP)</a>&nbsp;. Although this problem is classically considered hard, Peter Shor proposed&nbsp;<em><a href="https://polynonce.ru/what-is-elliptic-curve-cryptography-ecc/">an efficient quantum algorithm to solve it</a></em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The implications for Bitcoin are:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>(Address Reuse)</strong>  In order to spend Bitcoin from an address, the public key associated with that address must be revealed. Once the public key is revealed in the presence of a quantum computer, the address is no longer secure and should therefore never be reused. While it is a best practice in Bitcoin to always use new addresses, in practice this is not always the case. Any address that contains Bitcoin and for which the public key has been revealed is completely insecure.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>(Processed transactions)</strong>  If a transaction is made from an address that has not spent anything before, and that transaction is placed on the blockchain with a few blocks following it, then that transaction is reasonably secure against quantum attacks. The private key can be derived from the published public key, but since the address has already been spent, this must be combined with bypassing the network hashing to perform a double-spend attack. As we saw in Section III A, even with a quantum computer, a double-spend attack is unlikely if there are many blocks following the transaction.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>(Raw Transactions)</strong>  After a transaction has been broadcast to the network, but before it is placed on the blockchain, it is at risk of a quantum attack. If the secret key can be derived from the broadcast public key before the transaction is placed on the blockchain, an attacker can use that secret key to broadcast a new transaction from the same address to their own address. If the attacker then ensures that this new transaction is placed on the blockchain first, they can effectively steal all the bitcoins behind the original address. We consider point (3) to be the most serious attack. To determine the severity of this attack, it is important to accurately estimate how long it would take a quantum computer to calculate ECDLP, and whether it can be done in a time close to the block interval.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We consider the attack described in point 3 (attack on raw transactions) to be the most dangerous. To assess its severity, it is important to understand how long it would take a quantum computer to&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/discrete-logarithm"><em>solve the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem</em>&nbsp;(ECDLP)</a>&nbsp;and whether it is possible to do so in a time comparable to the block generation interval in the blockchain. For an n-bit prime field, according to recent research, a quantum computer can solve the ECDLP using 9n + 2&nbsp;<em>log2(n) + 10 logical qubits and (448</em>&nbsp;log2(n) + 4090)*n^3 Toffoli gates. Bitcoin uses 256-bit signatures (n = 256), so the number of Toffoli gates is 1.28 * 10^11, which can be slightly parallelized to a depth of 1.16 * 10^11. Each Toffoli gate can be implemented using a small circuit of T-gates operating on 7 qubits in parallel (including 4 auxiliary qubits). By analyzing this, one can estimate the resources required for a quantum attack on digital signatures. As in the case of block mining, most of the time is spent on distilling the “magic states” for the logical T-gates. The time to solve ECDLP on a quantum processor is τ = 1.28 * 10^11 * cτ(pg)/s, where cτ depends only on the error rate of the gates (pg) and s is the clock frequency. The number of physical qubits required is nQ = 2334 * cnQ(pg), where the first factor is the number of logical qubits including 4 auxiliary logical qubits, and cnQ is the space cost factor.</p>

<p>Figure&nbsp;<em>3</em>&nbsp;shows the performance of a quantum computer for attacks on digital signatures. Using a surface code with a physical gate error rate of pg = 5 * 10^-4, the overhead factors are cτ = 291.7 and cnQ = 735.3. In this case, at a clock rate of 66.6 MHz, the problem will take 6.49 days to solve, using 1.7 * 10^6 physical qubits. If the clock rate is increased to 10 GHz and the error rate is reduced to 10^-5, the signature can be cracked in 30 minutes, using 485550 qubits. The latter scenario makes an attack on raw transactions (point 3) quite possible and seriously threatens the security of the current Bitcoin system. Figure 4 presents an estimate of the time required for a quantum computer to crack the signature scheme as a function of time, based on a certain model.</p>

<p>A quantum computer can crack a transaction signature while it is waiting to be written to the blockchain and redirect the money to the attacker’s wallet. Currently, this would require a lot of time and resources, but technological advances could make such an attack possible. To assess the danger, you need to understand&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/quantum-attacks-on-bitcoin">how quickly a quantum computer can crack these signatures</a>&nbsp;. It all depends on the computer’s power and error rate. If a sufficiently powerful and accurate quantum computer were created, it would take only half an hour to crack a signature, making the Bitcoin system very vulnerable.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attacks on the Bitcoin protocol using known quantum algorithms and error correction schemes. While some estimates of the speed and scaling of quantum computing may seem optimistic, it is important to remember that there are several ways to improve the performance of quantum computers in solving the problems mentioned. First, the error-correcting code considered here is a surface code, which requires significant classical computational overhead for state distillation, error syndrome extraction, and correction. Other codes that provide transverse Clifford and non-Clifford gates can eliminate the need for slow state distillation. In fact, the slowdown due to classical processing for syndrome extraction and correction can be completely eliminated using a dimension-free protocol such as [PSBT10], which in a recent analysis shows error thresholds [CJS16] to be only about 5 times worse than the high-dimensional surface code. This can potentially significantly improve the overall error-correction performance.</p>

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, reducing the number of logic gates in quantum circuits is possible as more efficient advanced quantum computing techniques are developed. For example, using a specific large-scale problem (including oracle implementations) that was analyzed in a previous paper&nbsp;<code>[SVM+17]</code>, a direct comparison of specific gate counts obtained with the Quipper software package between an old&nbsp;<code>[HHL09]</code>and new&nbsp;<code>[CKS15]</code>quantum linear system solving algorithm was achieved, showing an improvement of several orders of magnitude.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given that Shor’s and Grover’s quantum algorithms have been well studied and carefully optimized, one should not expect such a significant improvement, but some improvement is probably possible. Third, different quantum algorithms can provide relative speedups. A recent paper by Kaliski&nbsp;<code>[Kal17]</code>presents a quantum algorithm for&nbsp;<em><a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/discrete-logarithm/">the discrete logarithm problem:</a></em>&nbsp;find m given&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/discrete-logarithm/">b = a^m</a>&nbsp;, where b is a known target value and a is a known base, using queries to a so-called “magic box” routine that computes the most significant bit of m. By repeating the queries, using carefully chosen powers of the target value, one can compute all the bits of m and solve the problem. Since different bits are solved one by one, the problem can be distributed among several quantum processors. Each processor requires a number of logical qubits comparable to solving the entire problem, but the overall time will be reduced due to parallelism. In addition, the overhead of quantum error correction is likely to be reduced since the phases in the quantum Fourier transform of part of the circuit do not have to be as precise as in Shor’s original algorithm.</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s proof-of-work satisfies (1) and (2), but we would like to find an alternative proof-of-work that does (3) better. Similar considerations have been explored by authors trying to find proofs-of-work that, instead of (3), look for proofs-of-work that cannot be accelerated by ASICs. An approach to this is to consider memory-intensive proofs-of-work. Several interesting candidates have been proposed, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://keyhunters.ru/quantum-resistance-and-momentum-algorithm/">Momentum</a>&nbsp;[Lar14], which is based on finding collisions in a hash function, Cuckoo Cycle [Tro15], which is based on finding constant-size subgraphs in a random graph, and Equihash [BK17], which is based on the generalized birthday problem. These are also good candidates for a more quantum-resistant proof-of-work. All of these schemes are based on hashcash-style proof-of-work and use the following template. Let be&nbsp;<code>h1 : {0, 1} ∗ → {0, 1} n</code>a cryptographically secure hash function and H = h1(header) be the hash of the block header. The goal is to find a nonce x such that&nbsp;<code>h1(H k x) ≤ t и P(H, x)</code>for some predicate P.</p>

<p>The fact that the header and nonce must satisfy the predicate P means that the best algorithm will no longer simply iterate over nonce x. Having proof-of-work in this form also ensures that the parameter t can still be chosen to vary the difficulty. We next analyze this pattern for proof-of-work Momentum, as this can be related to known quantum lower bounds. For proof-of-work Momentum, let h2 : {0, 1} ∗ → {0, 1} be another hash function with n ≤ . In the original Momentum proposal, h1 could be taken to be SHA-256 and h2 to be a memory-intensive hash function, but this is less important for our discussion. The proof-of-work is to find H, a, b such that h1(H kakb) ≤ t and h2(H ka) = h2(H kb) and a, b ≤ 2 `. (1)Let us first examine the running time for solving this proof-of-work, assuming that the hash functions h1, h2 can be evaluated in unit time. Taking a subset S ⊂ {0, 1} and evaluating h2(H ka) for all a ∈ S, we expect to find about |S| 2/2 many collisions. Note that, using an appropriate data structure, these collisions can be found in about |S| time. One algorithm then is as follows. For each H, we evaluate h2 on the subset S and find about |S| 2/2 many pairs a, b such that h2(H ka) = h2(H kb).</p>

<p>For each collision, we then test h1(H kakb) ≤ t. In anticipation, we will have to perform this second test 2n/t many times. So the number of H’s we will have to try is about m = max{1, 2 n+ t|S| 2 }, since we must try at least one H. Since we spend |S| time for each H, the total running time is m|S|. We see that it is smallest when |S| = q 2 n+ t , that is, when m = 1 and we just try one H. This optimal running time is then T = q 2 n+ t , and to achieve it we must use memory equal to the running time, which can be prohibitively expensive. For some smaller memory |S| &lt; q 2 n+ t the running time will be 2 n++1 t|S| . Now let’s look at the running time on a quantum computer. On a quantum computer, we can do the following. We call H good if there exist a, b ∈ S such that h1(H kakb) ≤ t and h2(H ka) = h2(H kb). Checking whether H is good requires finding a collision and hence requires at least |S| 2/3 time according to the quantum lower bound of queries of Aaronson and Shi [AS04].</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note</em>&nbsp;that this lower bound is tight, since finding such a collision can also be done in about |S| 2/3 time using the Ambainis Element Dissimilarity Algorithm [Amb07]. We argued above that finding at least one good H requires a set of size m = max{1, 2 n+ t|S| }. From Grover’s search optimality [BBBV97], we know that we must perform at least √ m many tests to find a good H. Since checking whether H is good takes |S| 2/3 time, the total running time is at least √ m|S| 2/3 . Since the classical running time is m|S|, we see that, unlike the current proof-of-work in Bitcoin, with this proposal a quantum computer will not be able to achieve a quadratic advantage once S becomes larger than a constant size. In particular, since √ m|S| 2/3 is also minimized when S = q 2 n+ t , the execution time of even the fastest quantum algorithm is at least T 2/3 , which is significantly larger than T 1/2 .</p>

<p>Examples:&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/publication">Momentum, Cuckoo Cycle, Equihash</a>&nbsp;. These methods make the task more difficult for quantum computers. The basic idea is to find a number (nonce) that satisfies certain conditions. These conditions are related to finding collisions in hash functions. The&nbsp;<a href="https://keyhunters.ru/quantum-resistance-and-momentum-algorithm">Momentum</a>&nbsp;algorithm , for example, requires finding two different values ​​that give the same result when hashed. Unlike the current proof-of-work in Bitcoin, with such alternative approaches, a quantum computer does not gain a big advantage.

<p>Numerous public-key digital signature schemes have been proposed in the literature that are supposedly resistant to quantum computers. Examples include hashing-based schemes (LMS, XMSS, SPHINCS, NSW), code-based schemes (CFS, QUARTZ), multivariate polynomial-based schemes (RAINBOW), and lattice-based schemes (GPV, LYU, BLISS, DILITHIUM, NTRU). Each of these cryptosystems has varying degrees of efficiency. A comparison of signature and key sizes is presented in Table II (in the original text). In the context of blockchain, the most important parameters of a signature scheme are the length of the signature and the public key, since they must be stored somewhere to fully verify transactions, and the signature verification time.</p>

<p>Although the lattice-based BLISS scheme has the smallest sum of signature and public key lengths of all the schemes in Table II, there are several reasons not to choose BLISS in practice. The security of BLISS is based on the difficulty of the NTRU problem and the assumption that solving this problem is equivalent to finding a short vector in the so-called NTRU lattice. It has recently been shown that this assumption may be too optimistic, at least for large parameters. Moreover, there is a history of attacks on previous NTRU-based signature schemes. Perhaps most importantly, BLISS is difficult to implement securely because it is highly susceptible to side-channel attacks. The production BLISS implementation strongSwan was attacked in this way by Pessl et al., who showed that the signature key can be recovered after observing approximately 6000 signature generations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Estimating the Error Correction Overhead in a Quantum Attack</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://github.com/demining/Quantum-Attacks-on-Bitcoin/tree/main#estimating-the-error-correction-overhead-in-a-quantum-attack"></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How are quantum error correction overhead factors calculated to obtain resource cost estimates for&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/publication">quantum attacks</a>&nbsp;on blockchains and digital signatures? The method is based on the analysis in [FMMC12, MDMG+16]. First, nT and nC are determined, which are the numbers of T-gates and Clifford gates required in the algorithm. The pseudocode for calculating the overhead is presented in Table III (in the original text).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>For an attack on a blockchain with nL = 2402 qubits, these values ​​are nT = 297784 × π^2 / (14√(10) · D), nC = 29.4 × nT.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>For a digital signature attack with nL = 2334 qubits, the values ​​are nT = 1.28 × 10^11, nC = 20 × nT.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking ahead a few years, we can assume plausible improvements in quantum computer technology. Assuming a quantum error correction code that supports Clifford and non-Clifford transversal gates, so there is no distillation slowdown, and that this is done without measurement, so no classical error syndrome handling is required, then the number of cycles required for one oracle call is determined solely by the circuit depth, which is 2142094. This is based on the total circuit depth, calculated as follows. The oracle makes two calls to the SHA256 hash function, and it does this twice: once to compute it and once to undo it. Each hash has a reversible circuit depth of 528768. Similarly, two multi-gate phase gates are used, one for mean inversion and one for function call, each of which has a circuit depth of 13511, for a total depth of 4 × 528768 + 2 × 13511 = 2142094 (these numbers are taken from [SFL+13] but can be further optimized). Then, accepting the potential overhead in space and number of physical qubits, but assuming no time overhead for error correction or distillation of non-Clifford gates, this implies an improved effective hash rate of hQC = 0.04 × s / √D, which is substantially faster. For superconducting circuits, ultrafast geometric phase gates are possible at ∼50 GHz, which is mainly limited by the microwave cavity frequency [RBW+12]. Using the above very optimistic assumptions, at difficulty D = 10^12 the effective hash rate is hQC = 2.0 × 10^3 TH/s.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The total number of hashes per second across the entire Bitcoin network is taken from blockchain.info. The data in Figure 5(a) are the hash rates as of January 1st (2012–2015) and January 1st and July 1st (2016–2017). The two dashed curves represent optimistic and less optimistic assumptions for the extrapolations. The optimistic extrapolation assumes that the current growth will continue exponentially for five years and then become linear as the market is saturated with fully optimized Bitcoin ASIC miners. The less optimistic assumption assumes linear growth at the current rate. By extrapolating the Bitcoin network hash rate, the difficulty can be determined as a function of time. The expected number of hashes needed to find a block in 10 minutes (600 seconds) is given by rate(t) * 600, where rate(t) is the overall hash rate shown in Figure 5(a). Thus, Bitcoin’s hashing difficulty is calculated as D(t) = rate(t) * 600 * 2^(-32) for the two scenarios described above. Figure 5(b) compares this with the values ​​from blockchain.info for January 1, 2015–2017.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several aspects of quantum technology development that need to be taken into account in the modeling. Since only a few data points are available at this early stage of development, there is inevitably a large uncertainty in our estimates. We therefore provide two different estimates: one that is optimistic about the rate of development, and one that is significantly more pessimistic. However, these projections should be considered as very rough estimates that may require adjustment in the future. First, we need to make an assumption about the number of qubits available at any given time. Since we are focusing only on solid-state superconducting implementations, there are only a few data points available.</p>

<p>Predicting the development of quantum computers is difficult because we have little information yet. Therefore, the authors of the article made two predictions that differ from each other:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Optimistic forecast:</strong>  Quantum computers will develop very quickly, and the number of qubits (the basic “building blocks” of quantum computing) will double every 10 months.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Pessimistic forecast:</strong>  The development of quantum computers will proceed more slowly, and the number of qubits will double every 20 months.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both predictions are likely not very accurate, but they help us understand how quickly quantum computers can develop and when they might become a threat to existing information security systems.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We predict that the quantum gate frequency will grow exponentially over the next few years. This assumes that classical control schemes will be fast enough to drive quantum gates at these frequencies. After a couple of years, the growth slows down significantly, as faster classical control schemes are needed to further speed up quantum gates. We limit the quantum gate frequency to 50 GHz (for the optimistic case) or 5 GHz (for the less optimistic case), respectively, mainly because we expect that classical control schemes will not be able to drive quantum gates at higher frequencies. (See, for example,&nbsp;<code>[HHOI11]</code>progress in this direction.)</p>

<p>Figure 6 shows the predicted number of qubits, the gate frequency (in gate operations per second), and the gate imprecision as a function of time. The fourth plot models the reduction in overhead due to theoretical advances. The predicted evolution of gate imprecision is shown in Figure 6(c). We assume that gate imprecision will continue to decrease exponentially, but that this evolution will stop at an imprecision of 5 × 10^-6 (optimistic case) or 5 × 10^-5 (less optimistic case). For the optimistic case, we expect gate imprecision to continue to follow DiVincenzo’s law, which predicts imprecision to decrease by a factor of 2 per year. The data are taken from the following table: (table not shown).</p>

<p>Finally, we expect the number of qubits and time steps required by any algorithm to decrease over time for two reasons.&nbsp;<em>First</em>&nbsp;, the precision of the gates will increase over time, allowing for more efficient fault-tolerant circuits.&nbsp;<em>Second</em>&nbsp;, theoretical advances will allow the number of qubits and gates required to implement the algorithm and fault-tolerant circuits to decrease. We expect this factor to be&nbsp;<code>overhead(t) = β^(t-2017)</code>, where&nbsp;<code>β ∈ {0.75, 0.85}</code>for optimistic and less optimistic assumptions, respectively.</p>

<p>In this article, we explored methods to recover lost cryptocurrency wallets and private keys using mathematical algorithms such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/discrete-logarithm">discrete logarithm</a>&nbsp;and hidden number problems, as well as&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://dustattack.org/blockchain-folbit-leaks">the BLOCKCHAIN ​​FOLBIT LEAKS</a></strong>&nbsp;data leak . We demonstrated how to use software to extract private keys from vulnerable transactions, showing that even secure systems such as Bitcoin have vulnerabilities that can be exploited to regain access to lost funds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To protect against threats related to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency transaction RawTX vulnerability, users should take the following steps:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Software Updates</strong> : Regularly updating your cryptocurrency wallets to patched versions is critical to security.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Improved signature verification mechanisms</strong> : Stronger input validation and error handling will help prevent the creation of fake signatures and protect users’ private keys.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Network activity monitoring</strong> : Constant analysis of network status and early detection of suspicious transactions allow for prompt response to attempts to exploit vulnerabilities.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication</strong> : Implementing additional cryptographic protection methods will significantly improve security.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To protect against potential attacks related to the RawTX vulnerability in Bitcoin transactions, users are advised to update their wallet software to the latest versions. Regular updates, the use of anomaly monitoring systems, and increasing user awareness of potential threats will help maintain the security and integrity of cryptocurrency systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The RawTX vulnerability in Bitcoin transactions poses a serious threat to the security of cryptocurrency transactions and the integrity of the blockchain. To mitigate the risks, users should regularly update their software, implement strict security measures, and constantly monitor the state of the network. These actions will help maintain the security and stability of cryptocurrency systems, protecting users from potential attacks and financial losses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our study shows the importance of mathematical analysis in cryptocurrencies and demonstrates the potential of using complex mathematical methods to solve practical problems in cryptanalysis. However, these methods can be applied both to restore access to lost funds and to exploit vulnerabilities, which highlights the need to strengthen the security of cryptocurrency systems.</p>
